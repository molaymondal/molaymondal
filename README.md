## 🚀 About Me

I work on **IoT and embedded systems** with a strong focus on **intelligent sensing, edge AI/TinyML, and reliable system design**.  
My interests lie in building **energy-efficient, fault-aware, and scalable sensing platforms** that operate robustly in real-world conditions.

I enjoy working **end-to-end** — from **sensor integration and ESP32-based firmware** to **wireless communication, data synchronization, and on-device machine learning (ANN/TinyML)**.
